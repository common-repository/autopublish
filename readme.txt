Highlight as you surf => Directly posts highlights to your website. Look/feel customizable. Very, very COOL

== Description ==

**Ever blogged about something you read online? Shared a webpage? Or linked to another webpage?**
Now automatically embed/quote a part of any web-page (and your comments) within your own page without ever leaving the page you are on - nothing to "join", no cost, NO FINE PRINT :) 

**To Try it:**

1. [On this page itself](http://go.roohit.com), or on any other webpage **type roohit.com/ before the URL** address (e.g. [http://roohit.com/google.com](http://roohit.com/google.com '')) and your mouse cursor instantly changes into a highlighter pen. We recommend you [get a button](http://roohit.com/site/1click.php 'Hassle free') so you don't have to type each time.
1. Select any text, it gets *highlighted* in color. (Once you'ved added this widget), the colored highlights get *automatically posted* to your site, as a hyperlink for your site visitors to see the same page as you: *still highlighted.* (Yes, it *works instantly* for everyone! :)
    - Optionally mouse over the highlight to make Comments, add Tags, keep it Private etc... 
    - Anyone can **share their highlights** to any social network such as Facebook, Twtter, MySpace, delicious, digg etc. from right here (try it!)
1. Go to your website (even from a *different computer!*), you'll see the **text you just highlighted on your web-page** (once you'ved added this widget)
    - If you made any comments they'll appear there too!

It **is** actually VERY COOL
